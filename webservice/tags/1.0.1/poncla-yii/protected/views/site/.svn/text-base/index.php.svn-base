<p>To be honest, if you’re a Fraternity or Sorority looking for a website solution, or online tools like calendars, messaging, etc, you’re going to have a hard time finding what you need. Sure, there are companies out there that will make you a decent custom website, but they also charge you a huge upfront fee followed by monthly charges for “hosting” your site. Of course there are free solutions... but they require a lot of work, maintenance, and are not designed for what you want to do. Plus, let’s not even get started on Ads and popups.</p>

<p>So here’s what we suggest: Stop trying to make a blog site into a website... stop trying to organize your chapter activities with a hundred posts on Facebook... stop paying for hosting, monthly charges, and hidden fees to update your custom site. Instead, come to Poncla.com and get the best of both worlds... a stylish home base for your Greek organization on the web with innovative, purely Greek tools... for free!</p>
